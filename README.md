# Rosalind Solutions

## Notes for Review:
  - For exercises with shorter inputs, I used direct input via terminal.
  - For exercises with longer inputs, I used `"if __name__ == '__main__'"` to facilitate more manageable testing.
  - Similarly, some exercises print outputs directly in the terminal, while others ( especially form the "Algorithmic Heights" section) write to an external text file due to lengthy outputs that may not fully display in the terminal.
  - For the resolution of the GC exercise, I had problems managing the FASTA formats, as I had never dealt with them before. While calculating the GC content itself was straightforward enough, I utilised online resources to understand how to deal with the format appropriately.
  - I have included in my repository some additional exercises that were not explicitly required in the assignment, but were necessary on Rosalind to unlock the specified exercises (such as "bin.py" and "fibo.py").
